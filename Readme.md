<!-- DAILY -->
## Daily Progress

### Day 1: (June 15)
Set up architecture, file structure, listed all opcodes with their gas and mnemonics.

### Day 2: (June 19)
Implemented arithmetic, comparison and bitwise operation opcodes.

### Day 3: (June 20)
Implemented memory, storage, PUSH, DUP and SWAP opcodes.

### Day 4: (June 21)
Reworked stack to work with bytes, tested and fixed all the previously added opcode implementations. Added JUMP and GAS functionality.

### Day 5: (June 22)
Added functionality for both execution and transaction context. Added instruction related to them such as CALLDATACOPY or GASLIMIT. Added EXTCODESIZE, EXTCODECOPY and EXTCODEHASH.
